# cyKlone



## Test vectors
The file `test-vecors.pact` is auto-generated by the JS tool in `/gen_test_vectors`. It contains pre-computed commitments and proofs.

## Test REPL files

### cyKlone.repl
Intensive test of the cyKlone contract. This test could take a lot of RAM (more than 2Gb), and a lot a CPU/time (roughly 1 minute).

### cyKlone-relay.repl
Test the relay and the associated gas station

## Benchmarks
The file `benchmarks.repl` does a Gas benchmark of each transaction.

Currently the result is:
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                       BENCHMARKS                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Deposit Gas:        1183
First work step:    109079
Inner work step:    108816
Last work step:     109185
Standard withdrawal:28794
Relay withdrawal:   29806
Relay withdrawal X: 29700
--------------------------------------------------------------------

```

## Running the tests an the benchmarks
Test most simple way to run the tests is:

```shell
make tests
```

and for the banchmarks:

```shell
make benchmarks
```
